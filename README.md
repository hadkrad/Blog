# Blog
I'll probably organize this blog later but one thing I wanted to write about was why sometimes I think it's okay to eat meat, even as a negative utilitarian. I think consciousness fundamentally is a burden. However, if a conscious agent is capable of reducing more suffering than it endures, then life is worth living for that agent. I'll admit, sometimes I just eat it because I'm too weak to do what I think is the right thing to do. That is not what I am referring to below.

The first type of situation that comes to my mind is volunteering at a food pantry. The pantry receives donations from local grocery stores that are just past sell-by date but still good to eat. Why should I not eat from the meat that comees? Especially if they have plenty? I'm very much a consequentialist when it comes to ethics. I guess one argument is that if the pantry runs out of meat, then someone that usually gets meat from the pantry might instead go out and buy some, and thus supports factory farming financially. Maybe that is a good reason. idk.

The other reason is wild salmon sometimes. Its death is inevitable. Deciding to eat it or not only affects a) how and when it dies, and b) removing its ability to have children. Why should I not eat it only to have it eaten by a bear or shark or bird. Or so it can live long enough to die alone. Or live long enough to leave baby salmon behind that ultimately get eaten by bears or sharks or birds. And it's not like other animals in the wild. They don't care for their young. It's not like your leaving orphan cubs behind.
